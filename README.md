Abstracto
Abstracto is an open-source project focused on simplifying account abstraction on blockchain applications. We are leveraging Thirdweb's social sign-in capabilities while developing our own Account Abstraction (AA) smart contract to enhance the functionality and user experience.

Introduction
In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, account abstraction is a vital component that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) seamlessly. Our project, Abstracto, aims to create a user-friendly wallet solution by integrating social sign-in functionalities while implementing our own AA smart contracts for enhanced security and usability.

Features
Social Sign-In: Users can create wallets using Thirdweb's social sign-in feature, streamlining the onboarding process.
Custom Account Abstraction: We are developing a custom AA smart contract to provide a robust and flexible architecture for managing user accounts.
Gas Management: Our smart contract supports gas deposits and withdrawals, facilitating efficient transaction execution.
Architecture
Abstracto's architecture is built around the interaction between our custom smart contracts and Thirdweb's services. The key components include:

AbstractAccount: The core smart contract implementing account abstraction, including transaction execution, guardian management, and paymaster configurations.
TokenPaymaster: A paymaster contract that allows users to manage their token deposits, ensuring they can fund transactions using ERC20 tokens.
Smart Contracts
The following contracts are currently under development:

AbstractAccount
This contract handles the core functionalities of account abstraction, including:

Multi-signature Guardian System: Allows for enhanced security by requiring multiple signatures for critical actions.
Transaction Execution: Facilitates the execution of user transactions, ensuring only approved actions are processed.
Paymaster Support: Integrates with our paymaster contract to manage transaction fees efficiently.

TokenPaymaster
This contract allows users to manage their token deposits and ensures that the required funds are available for transaction fees.

Current Status
As of now, we have implemented the social sign-in functionality using Thirdweb, but we have yet to deploy and test the smart contracts. The integration with the frontend is still in progress.

Future Plans
Complete the development and testing of the AbstractAccount and TokenPaymaster contracts.
Integrate the smart contracts with the frontend for a seamless user experience.
Continue to enhance the wallet's features based on user feedback and contributions from the open-source community.
